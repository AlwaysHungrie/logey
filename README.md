# Logey
:key: A simple keylogger (for Windows)

## Quickstart
1. Download logey from the [releases tab](https://github.com/exler/logey/releases). 
2. If you want to hide the console window, you want to change the DEBUG variable in `logey.h` to **false**. 
3. After using keylogger for a while, close the console window (or end the process if you hid the console window) and open the `logey.log` file which is located in the same directory you downloaded logey.
